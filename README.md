# Olympics Data Analysis Web App

## Overview
The Olympics Data Analysis Web App is an interactive Streamlit-based web application that provides insights into over 120 years of Olympic history. It allows users to explore medal trends, athlete statistics, country-wise performance, gender representation, and sports evolution through dynamic visualizations.

## Features
- **Medal Tally & Trends** – Track medal distribution across years and countries.
- **Athlete Analysis** – Explore athlete performance, age distribution, and achievements.
- **Country Performance** – Compare Olympic performances of different nations.
- **Gender Representation** – Analyze the evolution of male and female participation.
- **Sports Evolution** – Understand how different sports have changed over time.
- **Interactive Visualizations** – Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data representation.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **"120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results"** dataset from Kaggle.
